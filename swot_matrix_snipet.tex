\story
    {The german company \enquote{Mensch und Maschine} resells CAD/E/M
    products by the american company \enquote{AutoDesk} and develops
    own features and Add-ons. The attractive growth in sales, margins
    and dividend needs o continues to be a very good investment. The
    two-pillar business model of a high margin software development and
    lower-margin VAR/project business adds up pretty nicely. Over the
    coming years, M+M must increase it's margins and find ways to reduce
    costs, especially in the VAR-Segment! But the strong balance sheet,
    over 30 years of experience and low exposure to institutional investors
    makes it a great Peter Lynch story.}

{ % +++ STRENGTHS +++ %
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,noitemsep]
    \item Lead by founder Adi Drotleff
    \item Grew profitable with new issuance of shares - Buyback of \num{80592} shares @\euro\num{33,22}
    \item No customer accouts for more than 2\% of revenue
    \item Management owns  over 50\% of the company
    \item Strong balance sheet, ~\euro\num{15}m in debt, \euro\num{32}m CashFlow (9M 2020)

}
{ % +++ WEAKNESSES +++ %
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*, noitemsep]
    \item Increased outstanding shares: 2014: \num{15439}m to 2019: \num{16820}m shares
    \item Heavily relying on AutoDesk price policy
    \item VAR business expansion into other countries requires new offices $\rightarrow$ costs
    \item Strong Focus in \enquote{D/A/CH} region, maybe too much
    \item Personel risks, specific knowledge is required
\end{itemize}

{ % +++ OPPORTUNITIES +++ %
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,noitemsep]
    \item Germany requires BIM-enabled 3D models for public building projects
    \item High-margin internally developed software
    \item Economics of scale in VAR buisiness $\rightarrow$ Higher margins lead to lower costs
\end{itemize}

{ % +++ THREATS +++ %
\begin{itemize}[leftmargin=*,noitemsep]
    \item Autodesk main supplier in VAR Segment
    \item Heavily reliant on VAR business (roughly \num{70}\%)
    \item High cost, overhead for VAR business $\rightarrow$ low margins
    \item Takes further capital increases into consideration (For what?!)
