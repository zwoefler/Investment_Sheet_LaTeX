\story
    {The german company \enquote{Mensch und Maschine} resells CAD/E/M
    products by the american company \enquote{AutoDesk} and develops
    own features and Add-ons. The attractive growth in sales, margins
    and dividend needs o continues to be a very good investment. The
    two-pillar business model of a high margin software development and
    lower-margin VAR/project business adds up pretty nicely. Over the
    coming years, M+M must increase it's margins and find ways to reduce
    costs, especially in the VAR-Segment! But the strong balance sheet,
    over 30 years of experience and low exposure to institutional investors
    makes it a great Peter Lynch story.}\hfill
